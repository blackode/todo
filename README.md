#  Todo Think Bridge

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

I have manually added the seeds.ex file that do insertions into groups, tasks, and dependencies

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000/groups`](http://localhost:4000/groups) from your browser. To list Groups
